# CryptoClustering
Module 11 Challenge - May 6
I started this Assignment different than the others in that I did not rely on activities we did before from assignments, but instead re-watched the recorded sessions that covered the different scatter plots and assignments of data. Since I started the assignment already late, I focused only on re-watching the sections of the recordings that covered the code, not so much the explanation or student activities as those did not have the explanation of the code.

The primary problem solving I had to do was with syntax errors and making sure I was referencing the correct DF on the code, I kept getting errors wshen I was using the wrong data frame.
